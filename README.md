# slack-emoji-splitter

Splits an image into several parts to create a Slack emoji mural.

This is written in Alpine.js and depends on a few external libraries for processing and downloading.

## Installation

Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Caveats

You still have to upload the Slack emojis one-at-a-time :/
